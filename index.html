<p><h2>Biography</h2></p>

<p>
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I recently graduated from Macalester College with a B.A. in mathematics and physics with an astronomy emphasis. My research interests include galaxy formation/evolution, data science, and astronomical instrumentation, particularly at radio frequencies. Please see <a href="http://lbraltsk.github.io/resources/lbraltsk_fullcv.pdf">my CV</a> for more information on my academic background.
</p>

<p>
While I was at Mac, I was involved in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MacRocketry">high power rocketry</a>, maintaining operations for <a href="https://www.wmcn.fm/">WMCN 91.7 FM</a>, and running public observing nights at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MacObserving/">Macalester Observatory</a>. I was a regular columnist for <a href="http://rookiemag.com/author/lilly/">ROOKIE magazine</a> for over four years, contributing personal essays, advice, and featured playlists. I'm also an avid supporter of Minnesota United FC.
