<p><h2>Biography</h2></p>

<p>
I am a fourth-year undergraduate at Macalester College in Saint Paul, MN. My degree is in mathematics and physics with an astronomy emphasis. My research background ranges from solar science to neutrino physics to extragalactic astronomy, but my current interests include galaxy formation/evolution, data mining of large surveys, and astronomical instrumentation.
</p>

<p>
I am extremely passionate about science communication, outreach, and policy. I have been lucky enough to gain a great deal of experience in conducting basic scientific research, and it is my intent to work to facilitate such opportunities for others.
</p>

<p>
In my spare time I run, dance, dream about getting my private pilot's license, and support Minnesota United FC. I was a regular columnist for <a href="http://rookiemag.com/author/lilly/">ROOKIE magazine</a> for over four years, contributing personal essays, advice, and featured playlists.
