<!--- <p><h2>Biography</h2></p> --->

<p>
	I am a scientist by training and a communicator by practice. I'm currently serving as the Market Benefits Coordinator and Farmers Market Assistant at <a href="http://thelandconnection.org">The Land Connection</a> in Champaign, IL, where I'm working to expand the reach of SNAP programming and put more local, nutritious food on tables across the region. As I gain experience in the nonprofit sector, I'm focusing on improving my skills in community education, qualitative and quantitative research, and project management. My professional background is highly varied, and I'm a firm believer that a jack of all trades need not be a master of none.
</p>
	
<p>
	I grew up in Urbana, IL, eating green beans off the vine in my mom's garden and hawking wares for regional farmers at Urbana's Market at the Square. My love for science and education led me to Macalester College in St. Paul, MN, where I graduated summa cum laude in 2020 with a B.A. in mathematics and astrophysics. After coming home to Illinois, my prior experience in local food systems led me to The Land Connection. My work here is driven by my passions for teaching, communication, and directly helping people and the world around me.
</p>
<p>
	I'm the most myself when I'm outdoors—whether that be slinging peaches at market, hiking up mountainsides, or pointing out comets and constellations to anyone who will listen. I'm also a big fan of reading, running, and Minnesota United FC.
