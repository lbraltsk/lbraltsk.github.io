	Since spring 2017, I have contributed to several projects in extragalactic radio astronomy, all investigating neutral hydrogen (HI) in the nearby universe. Some of these projects have taken place at Macalester, under the guidance of Prof. John Cannon; in our work together, we characterized the neutral gas properties of several nearby dwarf galaxies, some of which yielded very interesting dark matter properties and star formation histories! In 2019, I took a summer student position at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy, where I worked with Dr. Betsey Adams on characterizing (and hopefully confirming) several ultra-compact high-velocity HI clouds as Local Group galaxies.

<p><h2>Signatures of Cosmic Rays in a Neutrino Detector</h3></p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Poster:</b> <a href="http://lbraltsk.github.io/resources/lbraltsk_reu2018_poster.pdf">"Simulating the Cosmic Ray Background for a Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Experiment"</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
	I spent summer 2018 as an NSF REU student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI, working in the field of neutrino physics with Dr. Joshua Spitz. Neutrinos are known to oscillate between the three lepton "flavors" (electron, muon, and tau), but results from past experiments suggest that there are oscillations occurring at frequencies other than those accepted by the Standard Model. I worked on a liquid scintillator neutrino experiment called <a href="http://research.kek.jp/group/mlfnu/eng/index.html">JSNS<sup>2</sup></a> that was designed to detect a possible fourth flavor called a <i>sterile neutrino</i>.
</p>

<p>
	For my project, I simulated cosmic ray showers in a detector geometry designed to the same specifications as JSNS<sup>2</sup>. From the energy deposition spectra and number of photoelectrons detected, I was able to test the efficiency of the outer layers of the detector at finding and identifying "false positive" events.

<p><h2>Spatial and Spectral Evolution of Solar Flares</h3></p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Poster:</b> <a href="http://lbraltsk.github.io/resources/lbraltsk_reu2017_poster.pdf">"Spatial and Spectral Evolution of Solar Flares in the HXRs and Ultraviolet"</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
	I spent summer 2017 as an NSF REU student at Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. Working with Dr. Jiong Qiu, I studied magnetic reconnection in solar flares using hard X-ray (HXR) data from the <a href="https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/rhessi3/">RHESSI</a> spacecraft and ultraviolet (UV) observations from the <a href="https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Solar Dynamics Observatory</a>. We classified each of the flares according to their spatial evolution in the UV.

	The event shown above exhibits both parallel and "spreading" motions, the latter caused by the closing of magnetic loops of wider and wider diameters.

<p>
	We also observed a negative correlation between the reconnection rate and the photon spectral index, suggesting that increased rates of magnetic reconnection are related to harder spectra. I wrote several IDL procedures used in the analysis and visualization of these data that are still in use at Montana State today!
