<p><h2>Macalester Public Observing Nights</h2></p>

</ul>

<p>
	Since fall 2018, I've worked with the Department of Physics and Astronomy to coordinate weekly public observing nights using Macalester's own 16-inch reflector telescope. Although we're located in the heart of the Twin Cities, decent observing conditions allow us to show a broad range of targets.

	We've welcomed Brownie and Cub Scout troops, visitors from other local colleges doing projects for classes, and any number of members of the Minneapolis/St. Paul community. Our public event for the lunar eclipse in January 2019 attracted over 150 people!

<p><h2>High Power Rocketry</h2></p>

</ul>

<p>
	I am a founding member of Macalester College's own high power rocketry team, and have served as its Class of 2020 Representative since its initiation as a student organization. The club has entered the NASA Space Grant Midwest High Power Rocketry Competition on two occasions; in summer 2020 we will be traveling to New Mexico for the IREC Spaceport America Cup.

<p>
	We've built rockets that can control their spin on ascent, that fly at supersonic speeds, and that were constructed by teams of students with no prior experience. Because Macalester is a liberal arts college without an engineering department, we seek to provide hands-on project experience to all interested students, regardless of background.
