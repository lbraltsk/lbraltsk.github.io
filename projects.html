<p><h2>Macalester Public Observing Nights</h2></p>

<p>
	While at Macalester, I worked with the Department of Physics and Astronomy to coordinate weekly public observing nights using Macalester's own 16-inch reflector telescope. Although Mac is located in the heart of the Twin Cities, decent observing conditions allow astronomy lovers to view a wide variety of objects.

	During my time leading observing nights, we welcomed Brownie and Cub Scout troops, visitors from other nearby colleges doing projects for classes, and many other members of the Minneapolis/St. Paul community. Our public event for the lunar eclipse in January 2019 attracted over 150 people!

<p><h2>High Power Rocketry</h2></p>

<ul>
	<li>Follow <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MacRocketry/">High Power Rocketry at Macalester on Facebook</a> for more information about rocketry and engineering at Macalester!</li>
</ul>

<p>
	I am a founding member of Macalester's own high power rocketry team, and served as its Class of 2020 Representative for its first two years. The club has entered the NASA Space Grant Midwest High Power Rocketry Competition on two occasions, and was accepted to the IREC Spaceport America Cup for summer 2020 (delayed due to COVID-19). I will not be able to travel with the team to their next competitions in spring and summer 2021, but I have no doubt that they will make Mac proud!

<p>
	We've built rockets that can control their spin on ascent, that fly at supersonic speeds, and that were constructed by teams of students with no prior experience. Because Macalester is a liberal arts college without an engineering department, we seek to provide hands-on project experience to all interested students, regardless of background.
